I'm a research technician at the [Brain Mechanisms of Pain and Health Lab](https://www.zeidanlab.com/) at *UC San Diego* and previously a neuroscience undergraduate student at *USC* and the [Brain and Music Lab](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/brainandmusic/). 

My research experience is in human neuroscience, using psychophysics and neuroimaging to investigate the mechanisms of complex cognition, including music, memory, and pain. In addition to domain research, I aspire to build computational tools to make scientific methods more accessible and reproducible.
